# 22Fall-AppliedNLP
This is the assignment and project files for USC-22Fall-CSCI5⃣️4⃣️4⃣️ Applied Natural Language Processing

-  Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis - a five class classification problem [HW1]
   -  Basic data cleaning and preprocessing for the Amazon reviews dataset which contains real reviews for jewelry products sold on Amazon.
   -  TF-IDF features extraction.
   -  Train a Perceptron model, an SVM model, a Logistic Regression model and a Multinomial Naive Bayes model on training dataset using the sklearn built-in implementation.
   -  Report Precision, Recall, and f1-score per class and their averages on the testing split of dataset.


  
-  Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis - a five class classification problem - extension [HW2]
   -  Word2Vec features extraction.
   -  Use PyTorch to implement the neural network models like Feedforward Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks(also, considering a gated recurrent unit cell).
   -  report accuracy on the testing split of dataset.



-  Implemented a Hidden Markov Model part-of-speech tagger for Italian, Japanese, and a surprise language from scratch. [HW3]
   The training data are provided tokenized and tagged; the test data will be provided tokenized, and the tagger will add the tags.



-  Implemented perceptron classifiers (vanilla and averaged) to identify hotel reviews as either truthful or deceptive, and either positive or negative. [HW4]
   Used the word tokens as features, or any other features that can be devised from the text.
